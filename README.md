## Description

- A simple SwiftUI APP to demonstrate how to use haptic function on iPhone 

- There will be two views for you to choose. First one demonstrate the default haptic that APPLE give us. The second view is the custom haptic view. Which you can adjust the slider to feel differnt vibration.

- I combine tabView and NavigationLink to switch between two different views

- Project was completed using 100% SwiftUI (No Storyboard)

- Did not use any design pattern

#### Frameworks

- SwiftUI
- CoreHaptics

---

### What I Learned:
- I learned how to imply custom haptic into SwiftUI
- Apple prvides some default haptics that we can use
- If I want my vibration to be more precise, I have to use "prepare" in my code 

---

## How To Use

- Clone the project and run it on Xcode
- Your iPhone has to be at least iOS 13 or above to use the haptic function
